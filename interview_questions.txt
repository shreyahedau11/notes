- how do you define a spring boot as a rest service?
	## using @RestController.
- did your service need any database?
	- 
- security mechanism u used?
- (Ans - OAuth2. who was OAuth provider?)
		- 
- How do u convert data from database to json?
	- how do you do that?
		# we get data in Object so we can convert that object
			       // Object to JSON String
			        String jsonStr = mapper.writeValueAsString(user);
		
-Can you filter the data using jackson parser? if yes how do you do that? which class is used for that?
			
- Can u parse Array within an array? how can you parse it?
- Endpoint to retrieve 2 different sets of data. 2 columns from mobile and 3 cols for desktop.
- service need to return more data like 1 million. 
- create a report and export to pdf/xml.(We cannot do paging) so how can you handle it when it returns 1 million records. 
- if i want to transfer a large file. then how do you do that?
- data types you have handled? (Complex datatypes a service can handle)
- a proc receiving table type parameter.
--------------------
 - difference between spring and spring boot.
	rate yourself in spring boot?

	Ans - add dependencies we want to use.
		- spring starter.
		- spring jpa
	    - create entity
			- controller class......

- how do you convert an object to jsonString with jackson.

	###  ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        // Object to JSON String
        String jsonStr = mapper.writeValueAsString(user);
	%%% 
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
	//from JSON String to Object
        User obj = mapper.readValue(a, User.class);


- Exact difference between xml and json?
- can we use 
- what do you mean by DI?
	- a s/w design pattern to develop loosely coupled code
- what do you mean by constructor based and setter inject and when to use?

Can we overload main method ?
yes - by changing the argument type/or no.

Constructor returns a value but, what ?
	A constructor returns a new instance of the class it belongs to, even if it doesn't have an explicit return statement.
Can we create a program without main method ?
	yes, by using static block
What are the 6 ways to use this keyword ?
Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java ?
	- cause of diamond problem.
Why use aggregation ?
	- having HAS-A relation
Can we override the static method ?
	no
What is covariant return type ?
	yes, when one overrides a method, the return type of the overriding method is allowed to be a subtype of the overridden method's return type. 
	
What are the three usage of super keyword?
	super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
	super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
	super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

Why use instance initializer block?	
	is used to initialize the instance data member. It run each time when object of the class is created.

What is the usage of blank final variable ?
	A final variable in Java can be assigned a value only once, we can assign a value either in declaration or later.

What is marker or tagged interface ?
	Marker interface in Java is an interface with no fields or methods.
	In simple words, empty interface in java is called marker interface. 
	Example of marker interface is Serializable, Cloneable and Remote interface

What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch ?
	Dynamic method dispatch is a mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime. 

What is the difference between static and dynamic binding ?
	Static binding happens at compile-time while dynamic binding happens at runtime. 
	Binding of private, static and final methods always happen at compile time since these methods cannot be overridden

How downcasting is possible in java ?
	 downcasting means casting to a subtype

What is the purpose of private constructor?
	in Singleton (don't want to that class to be further instantiated over ) 

What is object cloning ?
	to create exact copy of an object
	If original object has any references to other objects as fields, then only references of those objects are copied into clone object, copy of those objects are not created
	that means any changes made to those objects through clone object will be reflected in original object

(shallow coping)
-- cloning, changing anything in clone object will also change in orginal object.
		Shallow copy is preferred if an object has only primitive fields.
		Shallow copy is fast and also less expensive.	

(deep copying)
-- it also changes the referene of the object.
	- so any changes made in copied object does not change in the original object

3 Ways to initialize object
There are 3 ways to initialize object in java.

By reference variable
By method
By constructor
________________
What are the different ways to create an object in Java?
There are many ways to create an object in java. They are:

By new keyword
By newInstance() method
By clone() method
By deserialization
By factory method etc.

  				  <filter-name>CorsFilter</filter-name>
   				  <filter-class>com.howtodoinjava.examples.cors.CORSFilter</filter-class>
