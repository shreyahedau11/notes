S3

- provides secure , durable, and highly-scalable object storage.
s3 is easy to use, with simple web services interface
 to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

s3 is object based storage.
	- allows us to upload files.
	- this is unlimited storage (pay for your storage)
	- files are stored in Buckets(it is just a folder.)
	- s3 is a universal namespace. bucket name must be unique globally.
	 cause it is going to create a domain name.
	https://s3-<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucketname>
	eg : https://s3-ew-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
	- and it will give status code 200 if the upload is successfull.

s3 storage classes/ tiers
s3 = durable, immediatedly available, frequently accessed
s3 - IA = durable, immediatedly available, infrequently accessed 
s3 One Zone-IA = even cheaper than IA, but only in one availability zone.
glacier - archived data, where you can wait 3-5 hours before accessing
	(it is used when retrieval time is not bothered much. )
