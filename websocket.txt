websocket is used for communication
	
traditional approches were. we were having http connection.
	- it was unidirectional
	- Half duplex - User requests for a response and the server then serves it to the client.
multiple tcp connections - for each request a new TCPsession is needed to be established.
	and then closed after receiving the response.
Heavy- normal http request and response require exchange of extra data b/w client and server.
